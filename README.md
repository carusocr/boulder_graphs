# boulder_graphs
Bouldering problems use a simple number system to show difficulty. Trying to use a more descriptive method of polygon graphing.

General ideas:

This should be 

Characteristics represented in the graph:

Crimp - Amount of crimp or closed-hand strength needed for the problem. A problem with a lot of tiny handholds will have a high Crimp value.
Slope - Amount of sloper-specific, open-hand strength needed for the problem. This kind of handhold requires a very different type of skill and hang strength than crimps, and is represented separately. 
* maybe merge these into a single value and add 'Reach' to represent throws/dynos/long moves?
Power - Amount of raw strength needed for moves. Most problems can be done with technique but some still require some lockoff or pulling power.
Footwork - Level of footwork required. Tiny footholds, kneebars, heel/toe hooks, drop knees will all increase this rating.
Balance - Level of balance required...how to better define this? Some problems require you to put your body into a position where moving a limb a little out of position while reaching for the next hold will result in falling right off. This value should reflect that.
